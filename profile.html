                    spare time? How do you think
                    you can combine this with studying?</p>
                <p class="dodo">I am planning to fully focus on my studies. During my studies, I might start to look for
                    a job in the IT field. In my spare time, I like to do puzzle solving, watch movies, travel and cook.
                    I am thinking about developing an app about traveling or cooking. Also, I would like to take some
                    online courses about graphic design because it might come in handy.</p>
