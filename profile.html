        <h3>EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES</h3>
    <p class="jojo"> Do you work/are you planning to work alongside your studies? What do you do in your spare time? How do you think
        you can combine this with studying?</p>
        <p class="dodo">I am planning to fully focus on my studies. During my studies, I might start to look for a job in the IT field. In my spare time, I like to do puzzle solving, watch movies, travel and cook. I am thinking about developing an app about traveling or cooking. Also, I would like to take some online courses about graphic design because it might come in handy.</p>
